# KeraTorch : Keras-Like ML Framework

## Introduction

This project is a toy project to implement a Keras-like ML framework. The goal is to implement commonly used layers and optimizers, such as fully-connected layer, convolutional layer, ReLU activation, SGD optimizer, *etc*. 

## ðŸ“£ Shout Out To @omaraflak

This project is inspired by the Youtube video by [Omar Aflak](https://www.youtube.com/@independentcode). He explains how to implement neural networks from scratch, and the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/TheIndependentCode/Neural-Network). Overall structure of this project may be similar to his. I just want to add some functionalities, say diverse optimizers, batch learning, and so on. ðŸ™‚

## Technical Details

This project is written in Python. The main dependencies are `numpy`.
