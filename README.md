# KeraTorch : PyTorch-Like ML Framework

## Introduction

This project is a toy project to implement a PyTorch-like ML framework. The goal is to implement commonly used layers and optimizers, such as fully-connected layer, convolutional layer, ReLU activation, SGD optimizer, *etc*. 

## üì£ Shout Out To @omaraflak

This project is inspired by the Youtube video by [Omar Aflak](https://www.youtube.com/@independentcode), where he explains how to implement neural networks from scratch. 

In this project, auto-grad framework is supported. The framework is inspired by [PyTorch Autograd](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html). I am not sure if my version works similarly to PyTorch, but it is a good practice to implement auto-grad framework. My implementation is independent to PyTorch's one, so it may be poor in performance compared to PyTorch's one. 

## Technical Details

This project is written in Python. The main dependencies are `numpy`. 

## Milestones

> üî• **Feature, Not a Bug**
> - It should be tested if networks operate properly without batch. 
> - The gradient is not accumulated, which may cause problems when the same variable is used in different layers.
